This is my first attempt at using github and web publishing, so all comments are most welcomed. 
Had no formal html background but thanks to it-ebooks, these two webpages represents my somewhat best effort.....
I'm an undergrad in Electronics and having to google for the necessary materials can be quite a chore at times....
But I just like everyone else I'm sure, would appreciate at times, not having to think too hard on "key-words".....
There are a few webpages that have quite a good repositories of directories and links for the googler...but....
..what if...you really need it fast..?..and unless you already have an AI crawler doing your bidding...otherwise
...a good alternative is needed...these links you find here are a work in progress, and some of the materials...
you would not normally stumbled upon on your daily searches...
...the Gist...
..............
...sort of like a dedicated, non-linear "domain specific" intuitive portal ( semantic annotations will be added later..)
whereby a stop at one of these "dedicated search portals", is all that you need initially for all your keywords ....
...a sorts of "bottom-up and top-down concurrent augmented search paradigm", and once we have enough to call it a...
...mini ecosystem by itself....hopefully with the assistance from crawler bots...
and the data is aggregated and semantically fully annotated....life should be that much easier for the average 
student researcher prowling around....
I know this is all very grandiose for now...but there already exists such "search paradise" on the dark web....
...github is already "one" version of this ecosystem...
